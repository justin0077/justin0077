- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @justin0077 
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all kinds of frameworks and develop in my spare time.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about css, Sass, Flutter and Nuxt.js

I am working at Touch Creative in the Netherlands.
At this company I did my last internship to get my Bachelor degree in Applied Science.
After my internship and graduation I was able to stay as a Junior Front-end Developer.
To persue my dream and become a btter developer has been my dream, since I started developing.

Take a look around at my repo's and maybe being able to learn something from it!
